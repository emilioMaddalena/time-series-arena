# time-series-arena
 A collection of time-series experiments.

The goal is to bring models from different packages together with a unified interface, and test them on various time-series benchmarks.

Thus far I've been working on classical ARIMA, feed-forward neural nets, and XGBoost models.

I'm planning to add to the list: RNNs, auto-regressive Gaussian processes, and time series transformers.
